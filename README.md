*This fork has the purpose of making this code compatible with updated dependencies, mainly TensorFlow >=2.16.
I was able to achieve this by using the legacy Keras 2 (`tf-keras`) that was tightly integrated with TensorFlow.
BRAID breaks with the newer Keras 3 (automatically used by TF>=2.16).
I also untracked some files and made a `pyproject.toml` file so that `pip install ./source` will now automatically get dependencies.
The exact environment I used (resolved by `uv`, and which I confirmed works with the tutorial file with Python 3.10.12) is frozen in an updated `requirements.txt`.*

# Publication:
This repository introduces and provides BRAID (**Behavioraly relevant Analysis of Intrinsic Dynamics**)

Parsa Vahidi, Omid G. Sani, and Maryam Shanechi. *BRAID: Input-driven nonlinear dynamical modeling of neural-behavioral data.* ***In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning
Representations***, 2025. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=3usdM1AuI3.

# Usage examples
The following notebook contains usage examples of BRAID for several use-cases:
[source/BRAID/example/BRAID_tutorial.ipynb](source/BRAID/example/BRAID_tutorial.ipynb)

A .py scripty version of the same notebook is also available in the same directory [source/BRAID/example/BRAID_tutorial.py](source/BRAID/example/BRAID_tutorial.py)

# Usage examples
The following are the key classes that are used to implement BRAID formulation as explained in [source/BRAID/BRAIDModelDoc.md](source/BRAID/BRAIDModelDoc.md) (the code for these key classes is also available in the same directory):

- `BRAIDModel` [./source/BRAID/BRAIDModel.py](./source/BRAID/BRAIDModel.py): The full BRAID model class for fitting and inference including the optional preprocessing stage and post-learning stage 3. BRAID's main 2 stages are implemented in a separate class named MainModel in [source/BRAID/MainModel.py].

- `MainModel` [./source/BRAID/MainModel.py](./source/BRAID/MainModel.py): BRAID's main 2 stages implemented in a separate class. The BRAIDModel object build a MainModel object internally to perform stage 1 and 2.

- `RNNModel` [./source/BRAID/RNNModel.py](./source/BRAID/RNNModel.py): The custom RNN class, which implements the RNNs that are trained in stages 1, 2 (and the preprocessing/stage 3 stpes if used). 

- `RegressionModel` [./source/BRAID/RegressionModel.py](./source/BRAID/RegressionModel.py): The class internally used by both RNNModel and MainModel to build the general multilayer feed-forward neural networks that are used to implement each model parameter.
